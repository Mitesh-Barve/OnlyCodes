ðŸ”¹ What is a CNN?
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network, a deep learning model mainly used for image classification and recognition tasks.

It automatically learns features from images through multiple layers.

ðŸ”¹ Key Components of CNN Architecture
Input Layer: Takes the image input (e.g., 28x28 pixels).

Convolutional Layers: Apply filters (kernels) to detect features like edges, shapes, etc.

Activation Function (e.g., ReLU): Introduces non-linearity.

Pooling Layers: Downsample the feature maps (e.g., max pooling), reducing size and computation.

Dropout Layer (optional): Prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.

Fully Connected Layers (Dense): Flatten the data and classify into categories.

Softmax Layer: Outputs a probability distribution across classes.

Loss Function (e.g., Cross-Entropy): Measures the difference between prediction and actual label.

Optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam): Updates weights to minimize the loss function.

ðŸ”¹ How CNNs Perform Classification
Input image â†’ feature extraction â†’ classification.

Training involves feeding labeled images to learn the best filters and weights.

Prediction uses the trained model to classify new images.

ðŸ”¹ Applications of CNNs
Image Classification

Object Detection

Semantic Segmentation

Natural Language Processing (e.g., sentiment analysis)

Medical Imaging (e.g., tumor detection)

Autonomous Vehicles

Video Analysis

ðŸ”¹ Fashion MNIST Dataset
A dataset of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28) across 10 clothing categories.

Training: 60,000 images | Testing: 10,000 images.

Categories: T-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, ankle boots.

More challenging than the original digit-based MNIST.

ðŸ”¹ Steps to Implement CNN on Fashion MNIST
Import libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, etc.

Load dataset: fashion_mnist.load_data().

Preprocess data: Normalize pixel values, reshape to (28, 28, 1).

Define CNN architecture: Conv layers, pooling, activation functions, etc.

Compile model: Choose loss, optimizer (e.g., Adam), and metrics.

Train model: Use .fit() with epochs and batch size.

Evaluate model: Use .evaluate() to measure accuracy and loss.

Predict new data: Use .predict() on unseen images.
